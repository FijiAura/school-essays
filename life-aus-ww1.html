    <h2 class="title">Life as an Australian soldier in WW1</h2>

    <p>Before WWII, World War 1 was known as the “Great War”; the “war to end all wars”. Of course, World War 2 blown all of this out of the water; but that doesn't mean that WW1 was unimportant; far from that. This essay talks about the lives of Australian soldiers during World War 1.</p>

    <p>World War 1 started on the <strong>28<sup>th</sup> of July 1914</strong>, and on the <strong>1<sup>st</sup> of November</strong> that year, the first group of Australian and New Zealand soldiers going to fight in the war left Western Australia. The most famous part of the war <i>(for the Anzacs, of course; there are much more famous parts of WW1 without the Anzacs.)</i>,  thus with the most information, is the Gallipoli campaign. Because of that, this essay mainly focuses on that campaign.</p>

    <p>Likely the worst part of the Gallipoli campaign for the Anzacs were the <b>harsh weathers</b>. Whats not known as much was that at the start, conditions were relativity mild, due to being spring in the northern hemisphere when it started. Of course, not all "good" things last forever; as when spring soon turned into summer, soldiers described temperatures as <b>"over 100 degrees in the shade" (100°F is 37.8°C)</b>. Soldiers modified their uniforms, and some even went <b>shirtless</b>, and water was worth <b>it's weight in gold</b>. Fortunately, the campaign ended before winter began.</p>

    <p>But thats not all, because being an Anzac soldier in the Gallipoli campaign also meant living under continual fear of enemy fire, surrounded by filth, illness, disease, and death. The lack of water, as well as the lack of both variety and nutrition in the food available, plus how close they were to dead bodies <i>(with dead bodies, of course, having plagues of flies.)</i>; added to the problems already presented by the harsh climate they had to withstand; which was talked about last paragraph.</p>

    <p>For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australian and New Zealander soldiers who landed that day, it was their first experience of combat. The first evening alone had more than <strong>2,000</strong> of them killed or wounded. Plus, the area occupied by the Anzacs was tiny; less than six square kilometers, 6,906 people per square kilometer; more than Hong Kong!</p>

    <p>Therefore, during the <strong>10 months, 3 weeks and 2 days</strong> of the campaign, life for the Anzacs was, to put it simply; horrible.</p>
